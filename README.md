This action will run `PHPCS` together with [reviewdog](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog) to create a report for your pull requests. It was created by using the [action-template](https://github.com/reviewdog/action-template) created by the reviewdog team.

The WordPress rulesets are bundled and made available to `phpcs`.
